# Variational-Autoencoder
Implemented a variational autoencoder from scratch in the PyTorch library applied to the problem of reconstructing compressed images from MNIST dataset 

Develpoed as part of an assignment from my graduate course in Deep Learning (ESE 546 - Principles of Deep Learning) at the University of Pennsylvania
